# Underdog

Report. Rescue. Love.

Underdog helps you share the love you have to give to dogs, especially the less fortunate ones.

This app lets you report the location of stray or maybe lost dogs looking to find their way to their forever homes. It also helps you rescue the report cases by easily marking the locations on a map and navigating to said locations with a tap of the button.

If you are a rescuer, you can then report to the app that you have rescued a pup for other people to be able to contact you if you decide to look for a new owner for the pup or just share the joy to the community now that you have a new lovely pet.
